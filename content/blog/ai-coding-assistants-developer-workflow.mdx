AI coding assistants have evolved from novelty to necessity. Here's how I've integrated them into my workflow and what I've learned about getting the most out of these tools.

## The Current Landscape

The main players in 2025:

- **GitHub Copilot** - Best for inline code completion
- **Claude** - Excellent for complex reasoning and architecture decisions
- **Cursor** - IDE-integrated AI with context awareness
- **ChatGPT** - Good for explanations and learning

## My Daily Workflow

### Morning: Architecture & Planning

I start complex tasks by discussing architecture with Claude. The key is providing good context:

```
"I'm building a real-time notification system for a Next.js app.
Requirements:
- Push notifications to mobile and web
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Need to handle 10k concurrent users

What architecture would you recommend?"
```

### Coding: Copilot + Cursor

For actual coding, I use a combination:

1. **Copilot** for boilerplate and common patterns
2. **Cursor** for complex refactors with full codebase context
3. **Claude** for debugging tricky issues

### Code Review: AI as First Pass

Before requesting human review, I ask AI to review my code:

```
"Review this React component for:
- Performance issues
- Accessibility problems
- Security vulnerabilities
- Best practice violations"
```

## Prompting Strategies That Work

### Be Specific About Context

Bad: "Fix this function"

Good: "This function fetches user data from our REST API. It's called on page load in a Next.js Server Component. Currently it's throwing a timeout error on slow connections. Here's the function..."

### Ask for Explanations

Don't just accept code - understand it:

```
"Explain why you chose useCallback here instead of useMemo.
What's the performance implication?"
```

### Iterate Incrementally

Instead of asking for complete solutions, break problems down:

1. "What's the best approach for X?"
2. "Show me the core implementation"
3. "Now add error handling"
4. "Add TypeScript types"

## What AI Is NOT Good At

Be aware of limitations:

- **Domain-specific business logic** - AI doesn't know your business
- **Up-to-date library APIs** - Training data cutoffs matter
- **Complex state management** - Often suggests suboptimal patterns
- **Security-critical code** - Always verify independently

## Productivity Metrics

After 6 months of intentional AI integration:

- **30% faster** feature development
- **50% reduction** in time spent on boilerplate
- **Better documentation** - AI helps write docs
- **Fewer bugs** - AI catches obvious issues early

## The Human Element

AI is a tool, not a replacement. The most valuable skills now are:

1. **Knowing what to ask** - Problem decomposition
2. **Evaluating output** - Critical thinking
3. **System design** - Big picture thinking
4. **Code review** - Catching what AI misses

The developers who thrive will be those who leverage AI as a force multiplier while maintaining deep technical understanding.
