React Server Components (RSC) have fundamentally changed how we think about React applications. After using them extensively in production, here's everything you need to know.

## What Are Server Components?

Server Components are React components that render exclusively on the server. They never ship JavaScript to the client, resulting in smaller bundles and faster page loads.

```tsx
// This component runs ONLY on the server
async function BlogPosts() {
  const posts = await db.posts.findMany();
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Server vs Client Components

The key mental model is simple:

- **Server Components**: For data fetching, accessing backend resources, keeping sensitive info on server
- **Client Components**: For interactivity, browser APIs, state, effects

```tsx
// Server Component (default in Next.js App Router)
async function ProductPage({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const product = await getProduct(id);
  return <ProductDetails product={product} />;
}

// Client Component (add 'use client' directive)
'use client';
function AddToCartButton({ productId }: { productId: string }) {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  // ... client-side logic
}
```

## The Composition Pattern

The most powerful pattern is composing Server and Client components together:

```tsx
// Server Component
async function Dashboard() {
  const data = await fetchDashboardData();

  return (
    <div>
      <ServerRenderedChart data={data.chart} />
      <InteractiveFilters /> {/* Client Component */}
      <DataTable rows={data.rows} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Don't pass functions as props to Client Components** - Functions can't be serialized
2. **Don't use hooks in Server Components** - No useState, useEffect, etc.
3. **Don't import Client Components into Server Components without careful consideration** - This can accidentally pull code to the client

## Performance Benefits

In our production apps, we've seen:

- **40-60% reduction** in JavaScript bundle size
- **2-3x faster** Time to Interactive (TTI)
- **Better SEO** with server-rendered content

## When to Use What

Use **Server Components** for:
- Data fetching
- Accessing backend services
- Rendering static or semi-static content
- Large dependencies that shouldn't ship to client

Use **Client Components** for:
- onClick, onChange, onSubmit handlers
- useState, useEffect, useReducer
- Browser-only APIs (localStorage, geolocation)
- Third-party libraries that need browser APIs

The future of React is hybrid - embrace the composition model and you'll build faster, more efficient applications.
